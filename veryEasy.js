//Problem one
//Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”

//created two variables called numb1 and numb

const numb1 = 3;
const numb2 = 5;

//created variable diff to equal value between numb2 and numb1
let diff = (numb2 - numb1);
console.log("The Difference between " + numb2 + " and " + numb1 + " is " + diff);
