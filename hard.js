//Create 4 math functions, one called add() that adds 2 numbers, one called subtract() that subtracts 2 numbers, one called multiply() to multiply 2 numbers, and one called divide() to divide two numbers.

//created variables to input in the functions
const x = 10;
const y = 5;

//Created the four function
let add = x + y;
let subtract = x - y;
let multiply = x * y;
let divide = x / y;

//Testing if the functions work
console.log(add);
