//Problem two
//Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.                                                       Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

var name1 = "John";
var name2 = "Melissa";

console.log("The name " + name1 + " is shorter than " + name2 + " by 3 characters.")
